# FAQ

### Does Praetorius require a framework?
No. It’s a static build you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Squarespace embed).

### What Node version do I need?
Node **≥ 18.17**.

### Can I change skins later?
Yes. Re-run `prae generate --skin <skin name>`; your data stays the same.

### How do deep links work?
Each work renders as `#work-N`. Append `?t=SECONDS` for time, e.g. `#work-2?t=105`.

### Why won’t my audio play automatically?
Most browsers block autoplay. Click **Play** once to unlock.
